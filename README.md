Description

The Social Network API is designed to support a social media web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage a friend list. This API leverages a NoSQL database (MongoDB) to handle large amounts of unstructured data, providing efficient data management for social networking platforms. The API is built using Express.js for routing and Mongoose ODM for interaction with the MongoDB database, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
